## 🖐🏻 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

My name is Franco and I'm a software developer based in Buenos Aires. I have experience in using Expo React Native, React, Python, and Java, and I'm currently learning Kotlin. Over the past few months, I have been working on developing software related to healthcare and public transportation. My primary objective is to improve people's lives through the use of software.

In addition to software development, I also have experience in design and marketing. For the past eight years, I have worked with local and international businesses to help improve their branding strategies and identities.
