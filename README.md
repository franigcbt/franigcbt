## 🖐🏻 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

My name is Franco I'm a software developer based in Buenos Aires.

I'll be posting here some of my projects using Expo React Native, React, Python, Java, and Kotlin (currently learning). During the last few months, I've mostly been focusing on developing software related to health care and public transportation. My current goal is to improve people's everyday life using software.

As a designer and marketing passionate, I've been working for the last 8 years with local and international businesses to improve its branding strategies and identities. So feel free to contact me if that's the case or click the link to my portfolio.
