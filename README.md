# Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Franco I'm a software developer based in Buenos Aires. 

I'll be posting here some of my projects using Expo React Native, React, Python, Java, and Kotlin. During the last few months, I've mostly been focusing on developing software related to health care and public transportation. My current goal is to improve people's every day life using software.
